Off to the Playgrounds!! Wait. I should walk, not run while sharpening my pencil. Okay, this should be fun so I'll check back soon. 

Okay, just popping up to say I have begun reading and working on the first section of the book where I'll use playgrounds to learn the Swift programming language. I do have some experience coding in Swift, seeing as this is my second spin around. I'm off to see what I all I can do.
